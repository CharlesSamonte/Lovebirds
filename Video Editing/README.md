Video editing was done in Adobe Premiere Pro.

This was my first time using Premiere Pro and actually just downloaded the trial for 7 days in order to finish the work that Peter did in Premiere Pro. Learned the software pretty easily and was able to navigate through useful functionalities such as the effects and audio/music controls.
